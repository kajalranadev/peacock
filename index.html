    <p>There are three species of peafowl. The two most recognizable species are the blue, or Indian, peacock (Pavo
        cristatus) and the green, or Javanese, peacock (Pavo muticus). The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) was
        discovered in 1936.</p>

    <h2>Appearance:</h2>
    <p>The peacock is well known for its bright feathers, which it often shows off in a magnificent courting display. A
        peafowl’s appearance varies slightly depending on the species. The Indian peacock has very flashy plumage, with
        a bright blue head and neck, which they use to attract a mate. Meanwhile, the Indian peahen is brown in
        comparison, which helps her to hide from predators when incubating her eggs. There are several genetic color
        mutations of Indian peafowl, including white.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the Javanese peacock and peahen have similar coloration. However, the peahen’s colors are not as
        vibrant as the peacock’s colors and the peacock has a much longer tail. Javanese peafowl have green feathers on
        the head and neck. Both Indian and Javanese peafowl have bare patches of skin around their eyes and a crest on
        the top of their head made of feathers arranged in a fan shape.</p>

    <h2>Habitat:</h2>
    <p>Both the blue peacock and green peacock inhabit open lowland forests, as well as farms and agricultural fields.
        They can be found in both tropical and dry habitats. Even in their natural range, these birds roam in cities and
        parks in search of food. Meanwhile, the Congo peacock inhabits the forested interior of the Democratic Republic
        of the Congo.</p>
